# **Interactive DAG Visualizer**

Hi there! I built this project to help visualize Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in an interactive way. In this project, I use **JavaScript**, **React**, and **D3.js**. I wanted it to be simple, fun, and interactive â€“ so you can drag nodes and see links update in real time!

---

## **What Is This?**

This is a simple web application that shows a DAG with a few nodes and links. I made it with:
- **JavaScript** (keeping it simple without TypeScript)
- **React** (for building the user interface)
- **D3.js** (for drawing and handling the graph interactions)

---

## **Features**
- **Interactive Graph**: Click and drag nodes to see how the graph updates.


## **Getting Started**

To try out the project for yourself, follow these easy steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AQIB-NAWAB/dag-visualizer.git
   cd dag-visualizer
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the Application**
    Start the development server with:
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the app in your default web browser. You should see the DAG visualizer in action!
